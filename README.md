# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

> The dataset contained multiple data points from houses in King County in Seattle, Washington. The metric used to compare the model was mean squared error because the metric allows to explain how close the predictions were to actual price of the listing. Through EDA that the number of bathrooms were more significant than the number of bedrooms when comparing prices, the location of the house correlated to a higher price of a house and the square footage of the house correlated a higher price of the house.
